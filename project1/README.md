Hello to whoever is reading this! 

This is the password verifier project where it tests a user inputted string if that string is a valid password, for a password to be valid it must have 

* At least 8 charecters
* At least one capital letter
* At least one digit from 0-9
* At least one special charecter: @ or _ or $

It will test to see if it has all the requirements and give you the repsected output if it passed or not 

Test it and have some fun!
